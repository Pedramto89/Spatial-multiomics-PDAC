# Spatial Transcriptomics GNN Pipeline

A comprehensive Nextflow pipeline for analyzing spatial transcriptomics data using Graph Neural Networks with integrated histological image features.

## Project Overview

This pipeline demonstrates the integration of:
- **Spatial transcriptomics data** (gene expression + spatial coordinates)
- **Graph Neural Networks** for spatial relationship modeling
- **CNN-based image feature extraction** from histological images
- **Nextflow workflow management** for reproducible analysis
