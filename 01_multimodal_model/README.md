- `Spatial_multimodal.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis pipeline and models
- The dataset utilized in this project originates from the article "Spatial transcriptomic analysis of primary and metastatic pancreatic cancers highlights tumor microenvironmental heterogeneity," published in Nature Genetics in 2024 (Article link: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-024-01914-4). The original data provided by the authors was stored in an RDS format. For the purposes of this project, we converted it into an h5ad file format and made it publicly accessible through the following repository: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28835765.v1.
